# Welcome to my Blog!
*Jan 29, 2022*

Topic: **Meta**

—

Hi readers, welcome to my blog. I have decided to start writing a blog because there are a lot of topics that I’m
interested in that I don’t have much of a chance to talk about.

Today’s topic will cover the meta of this blog. I’ll discuss how I’m planning on writing content, how it will be
organized, and how it will be presented to you.

## What I’m gonna write about…
…is whatever I’m interested in. I want to use my blog as a personal outlet for what I’m learning or creating. I
typically create projects that never get any word out. Writing about the projects I’m working on in my blog should help
clarify what I’m spending my time on, what I find interesting, and may even help grow these projects’ exposure.

I also plan to write about topics that Im interested in. It really depends on what I’m studying or researching. Some
topics covered in my blog may concern my projects, others may not!

## Keeping Organized

This blog won’t be for everyone. Some topics I’ll cover might be boring to you. I’ll try my best to keep my blog posts
organized by **topic**. In addition, I’ll also attempt to create an index for how much requisite knowledge is needed in
order to be able to *understand* the blog post. I’ll try my best to make this (recommended) requisite clear by
describing what type of knowledge is needed (i.e. for an article about an introduction to quantum mechanics, I’d
recommend a pre-existing knowledge of linear algebra).

## Topics I’ll Cover

As mentioned earlier, I’ll cover topics related to my projects and studies. As of *now*, that includes any type of
mathematics, computer science, logic, physics, or really anything in STEM. However, don’t be surprised if I talk about
music, life, philosophy, or other topics.

Occasionally, I’ll make significant enough progress on a project to write about it. If that’s the case, I may use my
blog to promote some of these projects. For instance, as of now, I’m writing several SwiftUI libraries, and I’d like
them to gain some more traction. So, I’ll probably end up writing articles on how to use these libraries. In this way,
developers interested in building with new libraries can read the article to use the library.

## Things You’ll See

Don’t be surprised if you see blocks of code, like

```swift
var x: Int = 5
```

or mathematical statements, like $\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}i^2 + 1$, as a part of the blog post. I’m planning on using code
blocks and LaTeX to enhance my writing and clarify what I am trying to say.

## And that’s about it!

Thank you for supporting my blog early on. I honestly don’t know where the blog will go, if it will gain traction, and
so on. For now, my goal is just to write about what I find interesting. I’m not trying to make this an official blog
with marketing and promotion. This should simply be a resource to whomever is willing to read. I hope you enjoy reading
my articles as much as I enjoy writing them!
