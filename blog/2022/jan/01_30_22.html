# Where do Numbers Come From?

For centuries, people have used numbers to quantify metrics. Whether it be for counting apples, measuring distance, or
for performing calculations to launch a rocket into space, numbers have been integral in describing the world we live
in. It is important, I believe, for us to understand where numbers come from, so we can better appreciate their
importance as well as their rigorous formation.

## A Historical Recount

Since the dawn of humanity, humans have used counting methods to tabulate values. Ancient Mesopotamia was the first to
develop a base system. The Ancient Egyptians and Greeks were the first to develop numerals, or symbols representing
numbers. Today, in America, we use the Arabic numeral system ($1, 2, 3$) to represent numbers.

With the development of a rigouros foundation of mathematics based on pure logic by Greek philosophers and
mathematicians, it became imperative that numbers have a strict, mathematical definition based solely on logic.

Today, I’ll explain that definition in more detail. We’ll discuss logic, how we can use logic to form objects called
*sets*, and how we can use those sets to obtain $\mathbb{N}$, the natural numbers.

## Logic

We’ll start with logic. Logic is the study of sentential values, either **true** or **false**. For instance, the
statement

$$
P = \text{“This is a blog”}
$$

is **true** while the statement

$$
Q = \text{“Pigs can fly”}
$$

is **false**.

We can string logical statements together using **logical operators**. The most common logical operators are **AND**,
**OR**, **NOT**, and **IF**. Here are some more details about logical operators:

| Operator Name | Symbol | Type | Example |
| --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| AND | $\land$ | conjunction | “$P$ and $Q$ are both true” |
| OR | $\lor$ | disjunction | “either $P$ or $Q$ are true” |
| NOT | $\neg$ | negation | “not $P$ is true” |
| IF | $\implies$ | conditional implication | “if $P$ is true, then $Q$ is true” |
| IFF | $\iff$ | biconditional implication | “$P$ is true if and only if $Q$ is true” |
| XOR | $\oplus$ | mutual exclusion | “either $P$ or $Q$ are true, but not both” |

So, using the above statements for $P$ and $Q$, the following are equivalent:

$$
\begin{align}
P \land Q &\iff \text{“This is a blog, and pigs can fly”} \\
P \lor Q &\iff \text{“Either this is a blog, or pigs can fly”} \\
P \implies Q &\iff \text{“If this is a blog, then pigs can fly”} \\
\neg Q &\iff \text{“Pigs cannot fly”}
\end{align}
$$

Great, we can now decompose statements into logic and connect them using our logical operators. But what if we have
multiple similar statements, such as:

$$
\begin{align}
P_1 &= \text{“Adam is a logician”} \\
P_2 &= \text{“Ben is a logician”} \\
P_3 &= \text{“Cary is a logician”} \\
\vdots & \;\; \text{(and so on)}
\end{align}
$$

This is too much work. Instead, we’ll use boolean algebra to **quantify** the above to

$$
P(x) = \text{“} x \text{ is a logician”}
$$

This is called a **predicate**, and it gives way to two new **quantifiers**:

$$
\begin{align}
\forall x : P(x) &\iff \text{“For all } x \text{, } x \text{ is a logician”} \\
\exists x : P(x) &\iff \text{“There exists an } x \text{ such that } x \text{ is a logician”}
\end{align}
$$

We can use these quantifiers to formulate, from only logic, objects called…

## Sets

Sets are a collection of elements. For instance, the following are examples of sets:

$$
\begin{align}
A &= \{\text{apple}, \text{orange}, \text{banana}\} \\
B &= \{a, 12, \text{“cat”}, f(x)\} \\
C &= \{1, 2, 3, 4, \cdots\} \\
D &= \{x : x \text{ is even}\}
\end{align}
$$

Sets can contain anything, and they never contain duplicates. Every element of a set is unique, and sets with the same
elements are considered to be equal. Sets can contain other sets, and this will be important for us to know for later:

$$
\begin{align}
A &= \{\{0\}, \{1, 2\}\} \\
B &= \{1, 2, 3, \{1, 2\}, \{\}\}
\end{align}
$$

And, as you can see from above, the **empty set** or **null set** exists, and is symbolized using $\varnothing$.

And while items in sets can’t be explicitly *ordered*, we can form an ordered set (**ordered pair** or **tuple**) like
so:

$$
(a, b) := \{a, \{a, b\}\}
$$

With tuples, order matters, and

$$
(a, b) \neq (b, a)
$$

Like sentential values, we can also use operators on sets. The typical operators for sets are **union** ($\cup$),
**intersection** ($\cap$), and **difference** ($\smallsetminus$).

Informally, we can define these operators as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
A \cup B &:= \text{The set with elements of either A or B} \\
A \cap B &:= \text{The set with elements of both A and B} \\
A \smallsetminus B &:= \text{The set with elements of A, but not B}
\end{align}
$$

For instance, if we let

$$
\begin{align}
A &= \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \\
B &= \{1, 2, 5\}
\end{align}
$$

then

$$
\begin{align}
A \cup B &= \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \\
A \cap B &= \{1, 2\} \\
A \smallsetminus B &= \{3, 4\}
\end{align}
$$

With this, we can finally define what a number is.

## Numbers

Let’s define $0$ to be the empty set. We use the symbol $:=$ to represent a definition. Then

$$
\begin{align}
0 &:= \varnothing \\
1 &:= \{0\} \\
2 &:= \{0, 1\} \\
3 &:= \{0, 1, 2\} \\
\vdots
\end{align}
$$

As you can see, the numbers are defined recursively. Each number is represented by a set of nested empty sets.

Now, we need a way to increment our numbers. After all, it’s too much work to define *every single number*. So, we
define the **successor function** to be

$$
s(x) := x \cup \{x\}
$$

If you’re confused by the above formula, it’s simply written as this: The next number ($x + 1$) is itself, in set form,
unioned with the number itself. For instance, if we try to find $s(4)$, we know that it is the set $\{0, 1, 2, 3\}$ in
union with $4$. So, $s(4) = 5 = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$. Now, we can always get to the next number given any number. This
allows our numbers to be infinite!

It’s these numbers, defined recursively from sets, that follow a set of axioms known as the Peano axioms. Since these
numbers satisfy the axioms, they are considered to be a set of **natural numbers**, and can be represented with the
symbol $\mathbb{N}$.
